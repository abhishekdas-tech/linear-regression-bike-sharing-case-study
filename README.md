## General Information
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, experienced significant revenue loss during the pandemic and is now looking to strategically plan for recovery once lockdowns are lifted. The company seeks to identify which factors are most significant in predicting bike demand and how these factors influence the demand trends. This analysis will guide management in optimizing their business strategy, catering to market needs, and gaining a competitive edge in the industry.

Key objectives include:

- Identifying the variables that significantly impact bike demand.
- Evaluating how well these variables explain the variation in demand.
- Providing insights for demand prediction to help management adapt their strategy to meet market expectations.

## Conclusions
Here are a few observations
a.	Season: The highest bike demand is in the fall, followed by summer and winter, with spring showing the lowest demand.
b.	Weather Situation: Most bike counts occur in clear weather with a total of rides, significantly outpacing the counts during misty/cloudy conditions and light snow/rain. This indicates that clear weather conditions are strongly preferred for bike usage, while adverse weather conditions like light snow or rain lead to drastically lower demand for bike-sharing services.
c.	Holidays: Most bike counts occur on days that are not holidays.
d.	Working day: Fewer people are booking bikes on weekends and holidays compared to weekdays.
e.	Weekday: The bike counts across weekdays show relatively consistent usage.
f.	Month: Bike demand shows a clear upward trend from January to August, peaking in the summer months (June to August). After August, there is a gradual decline, with demand dropping by December. This pattern suggests that bike usage is highest during the warmer months (spring and summer) and decreases during the colder months, likely due to weather conditions.
